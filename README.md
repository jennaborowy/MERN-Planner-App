# MERN Planner Project
This project was created for my web programming class in Spring 2024, in which we learned how to build a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) application.

My app includes:
- a calendar, which was built using [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/docs) for React
- daily todo lists, which pop up in a modal when you click on a date in the calendar
  - check off tasks
  - uses CRUD operations
- task visibility from the calendar view
- toggleable light/dark modes

What I would like to add in my free time (which is rare):
- Events (tasks covering more than one day)
- Tasks/Events having start/end times
- Users
- Reminders
- Alerts for conflicting events, with an option to keep both or fix conflict
- Naviagting to different months by means other than clicking arrows
- Side notes
- More themes
- An overall improvement to the UI
